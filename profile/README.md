## Aether Project

This is the home of the Aether Project, originally incubated at 
[ONF](https://opennetworking.org) and now a stand-alone
project of the Linux Foundation. (It also hosts a read-only mirror of ONF's flagship 
SDN Controller, ONOS.) Aether integrates multiple subsystems, with associated repos also
located [here](https://github.com/onosproject/) and [here](https://github.com/omec-project/).
Aether documentation is available at https://docs.aetherproject.org and a community wiki is
available at https://wiki.aetherproject.org.
